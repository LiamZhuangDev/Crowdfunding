🪙 Web3 Crowdfunding Platform

A decentralized crowdfunding platform built with Solidity and Hardhat that enables project creators to raise funds securely while protecting contributors through transparent and automated smart contract logic.

✨ Features
🚀 Project Creation
- Creators can launch crowdfunding campaigns with:
  - Funding goal
  - Deadline
  - Project description
- Parameters are immutable once the project is created

💰 Contribution System
- Users can contribute funds to active campaigns
- Each contribution is recorded on-chain
- Real-time tracking of total funds raised per project

🔄 Automatic State Management
Projects automatically transition between states:
- Active → Fundraising in progress
- Successful → Goal reached before deadline
- Failed → Goal not reached before deadline

🔐 Fund Security
- Funds are locked in the smart contract
- If successful: Creator can withdraw funds
- If failed: Contributors can claim refunds

🎁 Contributor Rewards (Optional Extensions)

This platform is designed to be extensible. Contributors can receive:

- ERC20 tokens (governance or utility)
- NFTs (proof of contribution, rewards, perks)
- Future revenue sharing (advanced)

🏗️ Tech Stack
- Solidity — Smart contract development
- Hardhat 3 (ESM) — Development framework
- Ethers.js — Blockchain interaction
- TypeScript (optional) — Scripts and tooling

## 🛠️ Project Setup (Step-by-Step)

Follow these steps to initialize and run the crowdfunding project locally:

### 1️⃣ Initialize Project
```bash
mkdir Crowdfunding
cd Crowdfunding
npm init -y
```
### 2️⃣ Install Hardhat
```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat@latest
```
### 3️⃣ Initialize Hardhat (ESM Project)
```bash
npx hardhat --init
```
### 4️⃣ Create Smart Contracts
Create your contract files inside:
```bash
/contracts
```
Example:
```bash
contracts/Campaign.sol
contracts/CampaignFactory.sol
```
### 5️⃣ Test Smart Contracts
Create your contract test files inside:
```
/test
```
Example:
```
test/Campaign.ts
test/CampaignFactory.ts
```
Run hardhat tests:
```bash
npx hardhat test # run all tests
npx hardhat test test/Campaign.ts # run a specific test
```
---
### For frontend integration, you need to deploy the contract.

### 1️⃣ Create Ignition Deployment Script
Create a deployment module:
```bash
/ignition/modules/CampaignFactory.ts
```
### 2️⃣ Start Local Hardhat Node
It gives 10+ pre-funded accounts (each with 10,000 ETH). 
```bash
npx hardhat node
```
### 3️⃣ Deploy Contract (Local Network)
```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/CampaignFactory.ts --network localhost
```
### 4️⃣ Create Application Binary Interface (ABI) for contracts
Example:
```bash
/frontend/lib/abis.ts
```
### 5️⃣ Create Frontend code
Example:
```bash
/frontend
```
### 6️⃣ Starts localhost
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev # which run `next dev` in package.json
```
Then access the frontend webpage via http://localhost:3000/
Next set up Metamask for testing.

---

### 7️⃣ Import pre-funded accounts into Metamask wallet
```
Account Dropdown -> Add wallet Button -> Import Account -> Input the private key of a pre-funded account
```
Then switch to this account.
### 8️⃣ Connect the wallet to the local node
MetaMask / Ethereum provider (EIP-1193) API calls:
```bash
# check current chain id
await window.ethereum.request({ method: "eth_chainId" })

# Switch to local node (chain id: 31337, 0x7a69 in hex)
await window.ethereum.request({
  method: "wallet_switchEthereumChain",
  params: [{ chainId: "0x7a69" }],
})
```
### 9️⃣ Connect to Metamask Wallet on frontend page
```
Click Connect Wallet button on the top right corner.
Approve the request in Metamask wallet.
You should see connected account address on the frontend page.
```
### 🔟 Test compaign functions
- Create a Compaign
- Start the Compaign
- Import another pre-funded account and make a contribution
- Withdrawal and
- Refund
```bash
# fast-forward blockchain time to test withdrawal or refund
await window.ethereum.request({
  method: "evm_increaseTime",
  params: [7 * 24 * 60 * 60],
});

await window.ethereum.request({
  method: "evm_mine",
  params: [],
});

MetaMask - RPC Error: The method "evm_increaseTime" does not exist / is not available.
```
---
Deploy Contract to Sepolia testnet
### 1️⃣ Create .env file to store the Sepolia URL and private key
```
# Get RPC URL from https://infura.io or https://alchemy.com 
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/xxx...xxx

# Sepolia private key (must start from 0x)
SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY=0xyyy...yyy
```
### 2️⃣ Load Sepolia env vars in Hardhat config file
```
import { defineConfig } from "hardhat/config";
import "dotenv/config"; // must here if read from .env directly

export default defineConfig({
  ...typescript
  networks: {
    ...
    sepolia: {
      type: "http",
      chainType: "l1",
      url: process.env.SEPOLIA_RPC_URL!, // read URL from .env
      accounts: [process.env.SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY!], // read private key from .env
    },
  },
});
```
### 3️⃣ Deploy the contract to Sepolia testnet
```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/CampaignFactory.ts --network sepolia
```
